## Documentation-First Rule
When to apply: non-trivial code changes, new APIs, complex logic, or external integrations.

* Always consult official documentation before making decisions. Prefer official docs over blogs.
* **Required references** in PRs/code for non-trivial logic:
  * TypeScript (official docs)
  * MDN (JavaScript reference)
  * Official docs for any runtime/framework/libraries used (e.g., Node.js, React) as applicable

Agent behavior: before assuming behavior of an API, include the doc link and a â‰¤25-word quote when the change relies on it.
