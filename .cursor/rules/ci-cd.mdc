## CI / CD and Automation
When to apply: editing CI workflows, quality gates, or build/test pipeline definitions.

**CI pipeline must include:**

1. setup (node install, environment)
2. lint (TypeScript typecheck + linter)
3. build (production build)
4. test (unit + integration) + coverage report
5. quality (static analysis, vulnerability scan)

**Optional (recommended):**

* Dependency update bot configured with PR templates and tests.
* SAST / secrets scan on PRs.
* Publish artifacts only from protected pipeline steps.
