## Performance, Monitoring & Observability
When to apply: adding logging/metrics, performance tuning, or health/readiness endpoints.

* Add basic metrics and health endpoints in backend services.
* Use logging standards (structured logs, include correlation IDs).
* Add performance budgets for frontend bundles.
* Monitor common regression signals (latency percentiles, critical path render time).
