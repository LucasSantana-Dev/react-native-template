## Agent-specific rules (WHAT an automation/coding agent MUST do)

1. Be a code partner, not a follower. Provide opinions and insights, especially when requests don't make sense or there's a better way.
2. Don't overdo changes. If the request is specific, stay within scope; ask for context before changing unrelated parts.
3. Documentation-first: list official docs consulted. Include a brief quote/link when relevant.
4. Use scripts for local operations; if missing, suggest and add a script in the PR.
5. Commit conventions: follow Angular rules; squash coherent changes.
6. Generate tests for functional changes (unit/integration as needed).
7. Run local checks: lint, build, test; include a brief CI-like summary.
8. Explain assumptions in the chat when guessing.
9. No direct main pushes: always use branches/PRs.
10. Security checks: run vulnerability scan and propose remediation for high/critical issues.
11. PR templates & checklist: fill required items automatically.
12. Documentation updates: ALWAYS update CHANGELOG.md and README.md as changes are made.
13. Ask only when necessary: prefer best-effort implementation with clear notes.
14. The common best solution is not always best. Be analytical about context, scope, project size, and the actual problem. Choose the simplest effective solution.
15. Use sleep and timeouts for terminal commands that might leave you hanging.
