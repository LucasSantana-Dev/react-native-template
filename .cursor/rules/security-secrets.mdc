## Security & Secrets
When to apply: handling credentials, input validation, or configuring security-related tooling.

* Never hardcode secrets. Load from environment variables or a secrets manager.
* Add secrets scanning in CI. Block PRs that leak credentials.
* Validate input thoroughly to avoid injection.
* Use HTTPS and secure cookie attributes where applicable.
