## Enforcement & Automation

**Automated gates**

* Pre-commit: format -> lint autofix -> compile -> fast tests
* CI: full lint -> compile -> build -> test -> coverage -> security scans
* PR protection: must pass CI + at least 1 reviewer

**Tooling suggestions (React Native/TypeScript stack)**

* Linting and formatting tools: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript compiler
* Pre-commit hooks to run fast checks (Husky)
* Commit message policy enforcement (conventional commits)
* Dependency update automation (Dependabot for npm/yarn/pnpm)
* Security scanning (npm audit, yarn audit, CodeQL)
* Automated changelogs & releases
* React Native specific: Metro bundler checks, EAS Build validation
