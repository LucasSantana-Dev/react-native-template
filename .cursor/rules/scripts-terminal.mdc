## Scripts & Terminal Rules (Scripts Priority)
When to apply: editing scripts, npm scripts, or automation using CLI commands.

**Main rule:** ALWAYS use scripts in `/scripts/` for terminal operations.

**Priority commands (examples):** start, dev, build, test, quality, logs, stop, clean

**Never use direct commands in automation** unless those scripts don't exist, and this fallback must be documented in the PR.

**Agent rule:** Prefer script calls and include the exact command used in the PR description.

**Cross-platform & CI-friendly scripting**
* Use cross-platform environment handling in scripts.
* Use cross-platform deletion utilities instead of OS-specific `rm -rf`.
* Pass non-interactive flags by default in automation (e.g., `--yes`, `--ci`).
* Avoid OS-specific commands. Prefer portable CLIs.
* Prefer environment-based flows over duplicating environment-specific commands.
* Ensure logs are stream-friendly (no pagers). When a pager might be used, pipe to `cat`.
